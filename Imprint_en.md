## Disclaimer ##

### Liability for Content ###

The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As service providers, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws as per § 7 Abs.1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated as service providers to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time of knowledge of a specific legal infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

### Liability for Links ###

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.

However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal infringement. Upon becoming aware of legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright ###

The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution, and any form of exploitation beyond the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.

As far as the contents on this page are not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. If you still become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for an appropriate notice. Upon becoming aware of legal infringements, we will remove such content immediately.

### Data Protection ###

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data (for example, name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) may have security gaps. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.

The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly contradicted. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example, through spam emails.
